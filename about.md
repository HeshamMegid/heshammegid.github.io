Hi! I'm Hesham, a software engineer based in Egypt. I'm currently a Director of Engineering at [Instabug](https://instabug.com/). I occasionally write about software development on this blog, and sometimes other random topics too.

I started writing code when I was 12 years old. My first lines of code were in Visual Basic 6 and I immediately got fascinated by the ability to create something useful from code I've typed into a computer. My interest in software development kept growing until it eventually turned into a career.

### TracKit

I released the first version of my app, [TracKit](https://apps.apple.com//app/trackit-daily-tracker-logger/id684374465), in 2013, and have been working since then on developing and growing it. TracKit started as a very basic numbers tracker for my personal use but has grown into a much more versatile daily tracker used by thousands of users.

### Previously
* I co-authored the Become an iOS Developer with Swift course at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/).
* I helped hundreds of individuals learn Swift and iOS development at CareerFoundry as well as independently, through the now defunt Swift Mentor.
* I created [HMSegmentedControl](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSegmentedControl), an open-source, highly customizable drop-in replacement for UISegmentedControl that us used by more than 22,000 apps, including TikTok, PayPal, Imgur and Bleacher Report.
* I cofounded Grape 'n' Berries and lead an engineering team that delivered a number of high quality native iOS and Android apps.
