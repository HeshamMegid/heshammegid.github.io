Hi! I'm Hesham, a software engineer based in Cairo, Egypt. I occasionally write about software development on this blog, and sometimes other random topics too.


I'm currently squashing bugs at [Instabug](https://instabug.com/) and helping people learn Swift and iOS development at [Swift Mentor](https://www.swiftmentor.io/). I've also co-authored the Become an iOS Developer with Swift course at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/).

I started writing code when I was 12 years old. My first lines of code were in Visual Basic 6 and I immediately got fascinated by the ability to create something useful from code I've typed into a computer. My interest in software development kept growing until it eventually turned into a career.

### TracKit

I released the first version of my app, [TracKit](https://apps.apple.com//app/trackit-daily-tracker-logger/id684374465), in 2013, and have been working since then on developing and growing it. TracKit started as a very basic numbers tracker for my personal use but has grown into a much more versatile daily tracker used by tens of thousands of users.


### Swift Mentor

Over the past few years, I've been helping people learn Swift and iOS development at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/). More recently, I decided to start [Swift Mentor](https://www.swiftmentor.io/) and do that independently.

### HMSegmentedControl

[HMSegmentedControl](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSegmentedControl) is an open-source, highly customizable drop-in replacement for UISegmentedControl. It originally started in 2012 as a project to get myself more familiar with CocoaPods and the process of publishing a pod, then quickly grow to be used by more than 22,000 apps, including TikTok, PayPal, Imgur and Bleacher Report.
