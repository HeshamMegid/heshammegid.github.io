Hi! I&#8217;m Hesham. I&#8217;m an iOS engineer based in Cairo, Egypt. I write mostly about iOS development, and occasionally about cars and other random thoughts that cross my mind.

I&#8217;m currently squashing bugs at [Instabug](https://instabug.com/) and mentoring iOS students at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com). Previously, I have worked at [Sarmady](http://www.sarmady.net/), [Startappz](http://www.startappz.com/) and [Zoboon](https://eg.zoboon.com/). Also, I have cofounded [Grapes &#8216;n&#8217; Berries](http://www.grapesnberries.com/) then [quit it](http://hesh.am/2016/09/i-quit-the-company-i-cofounded/). I also coauthored the [Become an iOS Developer with Swift](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-an-ios-developer) course at CareerFoundry.

I’ve started writing code when I was 12 years old. My first lines of code were in Visual Basic 6 and I immediately got fascinated by the ability to create something from just a few lines of code that I started skipping school classes to go to the computer lab. I then taught myself PHP and MySQL, and built a number of websites (a few of them are still online, and I sincerely hope you don’t find them). One of them was a ringtones website (don’t judge me, I was 14 and ringtones were cool at that time!). It started with a few static pages and quickly evolved into a full custom-built CMS. I then moved on to start a small reseller web hosting business which I ran for a couple of years then sold to a bigger hosting company (with around 40 customers at that time).

I started to gain interest in mobile apps by the time the first iOS SDK was released. I couldn’t afford to get neither a Mac nor an iPhone, so I began to play around with Android instead. After graduation I worked with the BlackBerry SDK for a little less than a year (and hated it!), then finally made the shift to iOS.

### Apps

I’ve been developing for iOS since 2010. Here are some of my most recent apps.

### Open-source work

  * [HMSegmentedControl](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSegmentedControl): A drop-in replacement for UISegmentedControl mimicking the style of the segmented control used in Google Currents and various other Google products.
  * [HMSegmentedControl-Swift](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSegmentedControl-Swift): An attempt to create a version of the original HMSegmentedControl that uses modern Cocoa APIs and Swift 3.0.
  * [HMSideMenu](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSideMenu): Allows you to display a menu of items that show from the left, right, top or bottom of a view controller with a delightful animation.
  * [HMDiallingCode](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMDiallingCode): Gets the dialling code of the user&#8217;s current location by using CoreLocation and reverse geocoding to determine the country of the user, then retrieve it&#8217;s international dialling code. Additionally, it can be used to get the dialling code for a specific country or the counties that use a specific dialling code.
