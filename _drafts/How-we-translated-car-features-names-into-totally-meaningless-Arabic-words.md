Smart key -> ????? ????: There&#8217;s nothing about a smart key that involves a fingerprint.
  
Climate Control -> ???? ??: A climate control AC works just like home AC, you set the temperature and it takes care of everything, which in both cases (car and home) does not involve any touching.
  
Tiptronic/Steptronic transmission -> ???? ??: Again, people seem to prefer things that get touched! A Tiptronic/Steptronic transmission are just commercial names for automatic transmission with manual sequential shifting control.
