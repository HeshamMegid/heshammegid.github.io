No, it doesn&#8217;t make you a better employee. It makes you a loser. A workaholic with no life.

If you show up at the office in the morning and you know you&#8217;re only staying for a defined number of hours, you&#8217;ll find ways to be more efficient at your work. If you don&#8217;t then you&#8217;ll keep wasting time knowing that you&#8217;re staying at the office most of the day.

Stop starring at your computer, get up, get our and get a life.
