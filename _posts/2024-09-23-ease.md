Throughout my life, I have suffered from moderate to severe migraines. While I’ve accepted that this is something that won’t completely go away, I’ve learned to manage my migraines much better, resulting in fewer attacks that don’t completely disrupt my day.

I found that keeping a migraine diary to log potential triggers, symptoms, and medications was incredibly useful for discovering patterns, avoiding triggers, and identifying the most effective treatments.

I’ve tried many iOS apps designed for this purpose, but I didn't like any of them. So, I did what any software engineer would do: I built my own!

Introducing Ease, a migraine diary that helps users log details of their attacks, observe patterns over time, and easily share reports with their doctors.

Ease is the first app I’ve built that fully uses SwiftUI. While SwiftUI can be frustrating to work with in some cases, I believe the framework has matured significantly and is now suitable for most types of apps. In my opinion, SwiftUI should be the default choice for any new app, as it’s easy to fall back to UIKit when necessary.

Ease is available for free on the App Store, with a subscription option for Premium features. [Download it now](https://apps.apple.com/app/ease-migraine-tracker/id6670308958) and share your feedback!
