I have a ton of screenshots cluttering my iPhone Photos library. When I finally decided to clean it up, I downloaded a handful of apps that let you do that but I didn&#8217;t like any of them, so I decided to build my own (because that&#8217;s what programmers do, right?).

The result is [Photos Cleaner](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id974985042). Created during a few spare hours onÂ a weekend at a Starbucks, this is admittedly not the toughest app I have worked on, so I&#8217;m making it available for free.
