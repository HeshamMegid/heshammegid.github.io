Over the past year I have been growing an addiction to staying fit and living a healthy lifestyle. During that year I have realised that staying fit does not require expensive gym memberships or personal trainers. All you need is your will, your iPhone and some of the awesome apps below.

#### [RunKeeper &#8211; Free](http://itunes.apple.com/eg/app/runkeeper-gps-track-running/id300235330?mt=8)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319" title="mzl.vrpnctdf.320x480-75" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.vrpnctdf.320x480-75.jpeg" alt="" width="270" height="480" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.vrpnctdf.320x480-75.jpeg)

To me RunKeeper is the best app to keep track of your outdoor activities. It tracks your walking/running/cycling activities using GPS and displays useful information like the distance covered, average speed, elevation climb and heart rate (if you have a Polar heart rate monitor). RunKeeper will also let you set goals and keep track of your progress towards these goals, which is always a great motivation to go on.

#### [Hundred PushUps &#8211; $1.99](http://itunes.apple.com/eg/app/hundred-pushups/id301174591?mt=8)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-323" title="wZoOPztESat1tQ5aZ2j9Vg-temp-upload.jggdgdcb.320x480-75" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wZoOPztESat1tQ5aZ2j9Vg-temp-upload.jggdgdcb.320x480-75.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="480" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wZoOPztESat1tQ5aZ2j9Vg-temp-upload.jggdgdcb.320x480-75.jpeg)

Anyone who is serious about exercising doesn&#8217;t only want to do cardiovascular activities, but also increase their strength and muscle mass. Pushups are a great way to achieve that. Hundred PushUps is both a challenge and a training program to be able to do 100 consecutive pushups in 6 weeks. The app gives a step by step guide by measuring your initial performance, giving you weekly targets and measuring you progress against those targets.

#### [GymPact &#8211; Free](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gympact-money-as-motivator/id456068701?mt=8)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-325" title="mzl.wfffzbaj.320x480-75" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.wfffzbaj.320x480-75.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="480" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.wfffzbaj.320x480-75.jpeg)

If you have a gym membership but you are failing to go to the gym regularly or if you are generally skipping lots of your planned exercises, GymPact is made specifically for you. GymPact lets you earn cash rewards for exercising. Make a Pact of how many days you&#8217;ll work out per week, set the stakes of how much you&#8217;ll pay if you don&#8217;t, and check-in via GPS at the gym. It also has RunKeeper integration that lets you count runs, bike rides or walks.

#### [Charity Miles &#8211; Free](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/charity-miles/id505253234?mt=8)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-327" title="mza_384030876570286796.320x480-75" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mza_384030876570286796.320x480-75.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="480" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mza_384030876570286796.320x480-75.jpeg)

Charity Miles is similar to GymPact in the sense that it rewards you with money for your workouts, but instead of you earning that money, it goes to a charity cause you select. It&#8217;s a great motivator knowing that the kilometers you make while walking, running or cycling will not only be of a great impact on yourself but are also a tiny step into making this world a better place for everyone.

#### [All-in Yoga &#8211; $0.99](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/all-in-yoga-300-poses-yoga/id359426393?mt=8)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-329" title="mzl.zfkcoppj.320x480-75" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.zfkcoppj.320x480-75.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="480" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.zfkcoppj.320x480-75.jpeg)

In between cardio and strength training days you need to be stretching and relaxing your body, and Yoga is the best way to do so. All-in YOGA has over 300 poses with photos, videos and audio guides. It also features 3D muscle models for all the poses it has. All-in Yoga also features over 40 Yoga programs that you could follow, and you can even create your own program.

#### [WiScale &#8211; Free](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wiscale/id319085928?mt=8)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-330" title="mzl.jffhftgf.320x480-75" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.jffhftgf.320x480-75.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="480" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mzl.jffhftgf.320x480-75.jpeg)

Tracking your progress is as important as the training itself. Nothing is more motivating than seeing your weight go down, your body fat percentage decrease or your muscle mass increase. WiScale allows you to easily monitor essential health and fitness data like weight, fat mass, lean mass, BMI, blood pressure and heart rate. WiScale works with the [Withings Wi-Fi Body Scale](http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale), a smart scale that measures your weight, fat percentage along with other stuff and automatically sends them to the app (it can even tweet on your behalf if you want!).
