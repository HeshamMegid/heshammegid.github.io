I hate going to the office everyday. It&#8217;s noisy, full of distractions and my home workspace is far more cozy and comfortable to me than the office. I also hate the time and energy wasted on commuting everyday, and there&#8217;s no real value of being at the office when most of our work is done online anyway.

Recently I&#8217;ve been going to the office less and working from home more. While my experience with working from home has generally been positive and enjoyable, there are some things I had to take care of to make sure that my productivity is actually increasing compared to being at the office.

Every office has a lot of distractions, but your home can have many too. The television, your bed/comfy couch, family and even the fridge can be quite distracting at times. And just like when you&#8217;re at the office and you find yourself sitting in front of the computer for hours without getting any real work done, that&#8217;s even easier to happen to home.

Here are a few technique that I have been using to keep myself productive at home.

  1. **Dedicate an area to be your workspace. **Invest in a nice desk and an ergonomic chair. Make sure your workspace is free of distractions and away from noise. Mine looks like [this](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2013-11-27-01.45.11-1.jpg).
  2. **Put some structure to your day. **While a nice thing about working from home is that you get to have a lot of flexibility around when to start and finish work, and when to have breaks, you still need to design a structured daily routine and try to follow it as much as possible. It surprising how much more productive people can be when they follow a daily routine.
  3. **Analyze how you spend your time. **Use [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) to analyze how much time you spend on each app/website on your computer. You&#8217;ll be amazed when you realize that yesterday&#8217;s 8 hours of coding where actually 5 and a half hours of coding, 1 hour of communication, 30 minutes of Twitter and 30 minutes of using other random apps and websites.
  4. **Block distracting websites/apps. **Based on your horrific findings from RescueTime, use [SelfControl](http://selfcontrolapp.com/) to set a blacklist of websites to block during your working hours. You&#8217;ll be thankful every time you try to check Twitter and have SelfControl kindly remind you that you should be coding instead.
  5. **Turns off all notifications. **Put both your phone and computer on Do Not Disturb. Email can wait.
  6. **Schedule regular breaks. **Use [BreakTime](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breaktime/id427475982?mt=12) to schedule regular breaks. I schedule mine every 30 minutes. During that break I get to check email and other things that were blocked using SelfControl. Most importantly I must get up from my desk and walk around for a couple of minutes to release the strain put on my body from sitting.

If you work with a team and you need to communicate daily, working from home can present some challenges. Fortunately, there are lot of tools that help you overcome those challenges.
