  I&#8217;m heavy user of to-do apps, specially Wunderlist, but recently my to-do list started to be a place I dread looking at it. I haveÂ too many lists, overdue tasks, things that I need to work on today, things that I need to take care of a week from now, groceries shopping lists, and a plethora of other things.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Simply it was just too distracting for me. Just like the 1000+ unread messages in your inbox right now that makes it impossible to read a message without being distracted by all that noise.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  My primitive solution to the problem was to grab a piece of paper everyday, write only the important tasks that I need to focus on today, and ignore the rest of my to-do list for the rest of the day. By the end of the day, I throw away that piece of paper and start the next day with a fresh set of tasks. That approach worked quite well for me, so naturally the next thing for me to do as a software engineer was to turn it into an app.

  Focus List does just that. It&#8217;s a very minimal to-do list with only a place for tasks you need to focus on today. The list is wiped out clean by the end of the day so you always start with a clean slate next day in the morning (or whenever you tend to start your workday).
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Even though Focus List is very simple, I&#8217;ve been working on it for quite some time now. Since my goal wasn&#8217;t just to ship it, but rather to do some experiments in both the UI and the code along the way, I&#8217;ve changed the UI a couple of times and rewritten the majority of the code every time.
