**AdFree:** There are many high quality, free but ad-supported apps on Android. Having these ads on the screen usually isn&#8217;t a big problem unless you are playing a game like Angry Birds, where it becomes really intruding. AdFree blocks every ad server you could come through, and it regularly gets its database of ad server updated to add new ones. Result is no more silly ads preventing you from shooting that pig!

**ColorNote:** Although I haven&#8217;t found out yet the perfect notes application for my needs on Android, ColorNote comes very close to what I&#8217;m looking for. It lets you create notes in the form of plain text or checklists, you could also change the color of the note to identify its category, in addition to a list of other handy features. The only thing it lacks is cloud syncing, but at least it automatically backups your data locally.

**Firefox:** While there are many decent browsers for Android, Firefox does something very special. It fully renders Arabic fonts on non Arabic-enabled phones. Enough said.

**gReaderPro:** After trying several RSS feeds readers that sync with Google Reader I found this to be the best. Great for those who love to read their feeds on the go. Even better than Google&#8217;s own Reader app.

**i-nigma:** 1D/2D barcode reader. What makes it so special? Astonishing resposne times. Identifies the barcode while you haven&#8217;t even adjusted the camera to capture it!

**Llama:** Trigger certain actions based on you location, like turn off ringer when I arrive at work or turn on WiFi and turn off 3G when I arrive at home. Very handy once you teach it the locations you visit regularly.

**Lookout:** Comes in free and paid versions. Free version lets you find your missing device by showing its location on Google Maps from their web interface. It also gives you the option to turn on a loud alarm on the phone, so you could identify its place. Lookout will also let you backup your phone data to the cloud (contacts only in case of free version) and will scan each and every app installed on your phone to prevent any malicious code running on your device.

**MarketEnabler:** _Rooted phones only._ Many apps in the Android Market are locked to certain carriers or countries. Market Enabler will let you fake your carrier so you could access all the apps that were hidden from you.

**SetCPU:** _Rooted phones only._ Simply put, let&#8217;s you overclock/underclock your CPU simply by setting the desired CPU speed using a sliding bar. Be cautious when overclocking as the CPU chip could overheat and get fried!

**Shush!:** Every time you put your phone into silent mode Shush! will pop up asking you when do you want to put it back to ringing mode. Very handy if you always set your phone to silent at work and then forget to set it back to normal mode.

**TuneIn Radio:** Let&#8217;s you listen to an enormous number of radio stations from all over the world. You could find your desired station by name, country, genre or language.

If you know an app that you think should make it to this list please post it in the comments section.
