I wrote a [blog post](http://hesh.am/2013/11/hiring-software-developers/) a few months ago about hiring software developers.Â After which I decided I no longer want to do programming puzzles interviews. I believe the best way to show my skills to a potential employer is to either do a task related to what I would be working on and submit for evaluation, or to work with them for a few days on a actual project.

I&#8217;ve recently done an interview that involved a task, and it proved to me that even tasks can be screwed up in a way that shows nothing about the potential hire and does not evaluate their skills in any way.

My task was to request a feed, parse it, and display 3 pieces of information and an image in a list. This task was way too simple to prove anything. Any beginner iOS developer can do this and I thought I would finish it in a maximum of 15 to 20 minutes.

That particular company&#8217;s APIs use JSON but they can&#8217;t give me access to the APIs, which I do understand. So instead I was given a URL to an RSS feed to work with. While that makes the task a bit harder for me since I never had to parse RSS feeds before, it also makes it even more pointless.

To me it was like going for a driving test, and being told that all I need to do to pass the test is to start the car. That doesn&#8217;t prove in any way that I can or cannot drive. To make it even worse, instead of giving me a car, they would give me a truck. Now I need to figure out how to start a truck, to prove that I can drive a car.

I took me 2 hours to figure out how to parse the RSS feed, extract the data I need using regex (since it was all inside a single tag) and present it in a table view.

I ended up being rejected. When I enquired more about the reason I got rejected I was told that it was because of my speed. Again, that is totally pointless. Does completing the task in one hour instead of two prove I&#8217;m a better engineer? I would have taken far less time if I worked with RSS before. So was the task&#8217;s main goal to test whether I can work with RSS or not? Also pointless, since they don&#8217;t need that particular skill (which anyone can learn in a very short time anyway).

I thought that programming puzzles interviews make companies miss out on good engineers because they don&#8217;t show their real skills, and that tasks were much better. Turns out you can make tasks dumb enough to do the exact same thing.
