From the 28th to the 31st of December I will be cycling from Taba to Luxor as part of the Global Biking Initiative (GBI) which aims to gather bikers from all around the world to bike in support for charity.

#### What is GBI?

GBI started in 2007 with just 2 Vodafone employees from Germany that biked all the way to the UK. Each year the tour got bigger and bigger. By 2012, 365 bikers from around the world (including 47 from Egypt) biked from Oslo to Dusseldorf and raised 210,000 Euros for various charity causes. This year there are going to be 2 tours; the usual one in Europe and a local one in Egypt.

#### Charity Causes

Charity funds are raised before the tour starts. Each country raises money for a charity cause they choose. From 2009 till 2013, Egypt has raised a total of 775,000 EGP. Starting from 2011, the money raised goes to Alashanek Ya Balady NGO, with the goal of supporting 1,000 poor families. In 2013, the Egyptian team continues to work on the same cause.

#### The Route for GBI 2012

GBI Egypt starts at Taba and goes through Dahab, Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada, Marsa Alam, Qena and ends in Luxor totalling 300 km over 4 days.
