I have just finished reading [I&#8217;m Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59](http://www.amazon.com/Im-Feeling-Lucky-Confessions-Employee/dp/0547416997), a really nice book giving an insider view of how Google works.

Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:

> In google&#8217;s culture, When you ran into a wall, you built a ladder. If there was a moat beyond the wall, you made a boat. If there was a crocodile in the moat, you fed it one of your arms and used the other to paddle across. The takeaway was “Take responsibility. Do something.”
> 
> If you only know how to do A, and it turns out the company moves in a way that A isn&#8217;t important anymore, you have an intrinsic reaction to argue that we must do A. If you are a generalist you are much less threatened by that. Instead, it&#8217;s &#8220;Fine. Great. Here is something else to do that&#8217;s exciting&#8221;.
> 
> Hire ability over experience.
