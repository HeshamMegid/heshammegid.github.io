One of the annoyances of Fiats equipped with Blue & Me infotainment system is that during a phone call you can&#8217;t view the trip computer data. This is particularly annoying when you are having a long phone call and driving on a highway for example where you constantly need to check your trip computer (to monitor the distance you have traveled or maintain an average speed for example).

I kept tinkering with my car till I found a very simple solution for this:

  1. During a phone call, turn cruise control on. You don&#8217;t have to actually engage it, just rotate the stalk to turn it on.
  2. Turn it off again quickly.
  3. While the information screen is still saying &#8220;Cruise Control Off&#8221;, press the trip computer button.
  4. You now have full access to your trip computer data while you are having a phone call.
  5. Enjoy and promise me you are not going to buy another car that uses Microsoft software.
