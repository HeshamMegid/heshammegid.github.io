I just finished listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mars-Venus-Collide-Relationships-Understanding/dp/0061242969" target="_blank">Why Mars and Venus Collide</a> andÂ I think it&#8217;s a great book just like Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus. I couldn&#8217;t summarize the book in a few helpful points, so I would like to share the two following quotes with you.

> _You cannot simply behave and respond however you happen to feel that day. To love someone, you must deliberately and wisely choose what you do and how you respond. When you make your partner more important than how you feel, you will feel more love and connection._
> 
> <!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Helvetica} -->

> _It&#8217;s not enough to simply react to life&#8217;s changes, you must take hold of your life and repeatedly and dynamically correct the direction you&#8217;re being taken._

I recommend you read it if you are interested in improving your relationship.
