I&#8217;ve been working as a software developer for a number of Egyptian tech companies for a little over 3 years, both on full-time basis and as a contractor, and I&#8217;ve learned a few lessons that I would like to share here.

I&#8217;m not in any way claiming to be an expert or that I&#8217;ve got software development demystified, so if you disagree with me please leave a comment and let&#8217;s discuss it.

#### Respect the technology

Your company might not be a software development house, and your main product might not be an app, but if you have an in-house development team, chances are your product relies heavily on technology. So respect the technology and learn to do software development properly. Don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;ll do just fine if you hire a few mediocre developers and a couple of managers with no technical background whatsoever.

#### Evaluate work properly

The best software developers aren&#8217;t the ones who write the biggest amount of code in the least amount of time. Assessing people by how fast they can get a job done with no consideration to quality is just wrong.

#### Hire product owners with technical backgrounds

In most companies I have worked with, I&#8217;ve seen a major problem with the role of product owners. People with no technical backgrounds struggle with this job. They have completely unrealistic expectations, and in many cases they insist on requirements that are just plain wrong for the technologies being used.

I believe those roles should be played by tech savvy people, preferably software developers who have the qualities needed to be product owners.

#### <span style="font-size: 1em;">Project schedule is determined by the people who build it</span>

A project&#8217;s schedule should be determined by people who are going to build it, not by project managers or marketing managers.

&#8220;But can&#8217;t we do better?&#8221;, the project managers will wonder as soon as they hear the developers&#8217; estimates. If you&#8217;re working with developers who are really good, they will know how long to takes to finish a task, but they can&#8217;t change it, at least without compromising quality or changing the specs.

#### Trust your team

I know trust is earned not given, but you really can&#8217;t distrust people with basic stuff like the fact that will actually do work while working remotely. If you don&#8217;t trust me with that, just don&#8217;t hire me.

#### Fire people when you need to

I have never seen anyone get fired. Even people that cannot pull their own weight and it&#8217;s obvious to everyone that they are slowing the team down. Those should really be fired.

#### Fast and good is not cheap

Everyone seems to be ignoring the basic fast/good/cheap rule of software development. You can only maximize two of these while compromising on the third. You want a high quality product and you want it fast? That&#8217;s going to cost you a lot of money. You want it fast and cheap? It will be buggy. Of course these aren&#8217;t binary switches, and you could always find a balance between the 3, but you just can&#8217;t have all three.

#### Don&#8217;t give fake titles

Top managers should not be dictators. Hire good people and let them do their job. Don&#8217;t hire people that you use as a tool to turn your commands into code or artwork. Don&#8217;t give people fake managerial titles when they have no say whatsoever in decisions related to their work or the work of the people they are supervising.

#### Don&#8217;t expect people to use their own hardware

I can&#8217;t believe I actually have to include this, but a few companies believe that you should be using your own personal hardware (computer/phones/tablets) to get their work done. Should I pay my electricity bill too? This is completely unacceptable. If you can&#8217;t afford to buy your team the hardware they need, then you can&#8217;t afford to hire them. So simply don&#8217;t.

Don&#8217;t let this post make you think that I have had 3 horrible years in my career. These are just the things I don&#8217;t like, and I can&#8217;t deny that I have learned a lot at each company I have worked at.
