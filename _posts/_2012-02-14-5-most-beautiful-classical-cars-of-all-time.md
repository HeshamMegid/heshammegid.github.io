You don&#8217;t consider yourself a true petrolhead unless you have a lust for classical cars. I admire classical cars mainly because of how beautiful they look. The unique styling will immediately make you forget how unreliable, uncomfortable and sometimes downright horrific these cars were.

Here&#8217;s my list of the 5 most beautiful cars of all time.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-217" title="1962 Ferrari 250 GTO" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1962_ferrari_250_gto-pic-49178-300x181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1962_ferrari_250_gto-pic-49178.jpeg)

**5. 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO:** Originally designed to compete in GT Racing, has a 3.0L V12 engine. The GTO became one of collectors favorites. In 2010 a fine example of the GTO was sold for 18.8 million USD.

**4. 1958 Chevrolet Impala Convertible Coupe:** 5.3 meters of hot American exotic design with it&#8217;s unique deeply sculptured rear fender. The first generation Impala will always remain my favorite as Chevy seemed to go for more conservative styling with each new generation. I know the Impala doesn&#8217;t have the pedigree as other cars in this list, but remember this is more about the design than anything else.

**3. 1957 Chevrolet Corvette:** The revised version of the first generation Chevy Vette is strikingly beautiful. Named after a type of small, maneuverable warship, the Corvette was the first sports car ever to be produced by Chevrolet. Hand build and only available in short supply, the C1 Corvette is a true collectible with a very respectable racing pedigree.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-220" title="1963 Jaguar E-Type" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1963-jaguar-e-type_thumb-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1963-jaguar-e-type_thumb.jpg)

**2. 1963 Jaguar E-Type:** The E-Type has been an icon since day one. On its release Enzo Ferrari called it &#8220;The most beautiful car ever made&#8221;. In addition to being beautiful, the E-Type was a high performance piece of engineering equipped with the latest technologies of its time. The E-Type got so many awards over the years and is still getting more till now. Top Gear also had a special tribute [celebrating 50 years of the E-Type](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLkEBRoilJ8), in their usual hilarious fashion.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-221" title="1957 Mercedes 300SL Gullwing" src="http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1957-mercedes-300sl-gullwing-0043-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />](http://hesh.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1957-mercedes-300sl-gullwing-0043.jpg)

**1. 1957 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing:** No words could describe how beautiful and unique the 300SL Gullwing is. Initially introduced as a racing car, then a road model was build later on. The distinctive gull wing doors which are only available on the Coupe version are utterly unpractical which makes it even more special. The 300SL has a 3.0L engine generating 222 hp and had some technology firsts like direct fuel injection.

**Aston Martin DB5 Vantage Convertible: **This one didn&#8217;t make it to the original list because (quite embarrassingly) I forgot about it!  The strikingly beautiful DB5 was introduced in 1963 and only 12 convertibles were originally fitted with a factory Vantage engine which makes it very rare. The DB5 has a 4.0L engine that produced 315 hp which was very adequate for its time. The DB5 gained its popularity from being the first car to be used in James Bond&#8217;s movies and has remained as the most recognized car in all of his movies.
