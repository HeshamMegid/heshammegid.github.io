If you have a Fiat equipped with a Blue & Me infotainment system you have probably tried to stream audio from your phone to the car. That&#8217;s not possible because Blue & Me doesn&#8217;t support A2DP, the protocol that enables audio to be streamed from one device to another (which is really stupid from Fiat and Microsoft since that could be enabled just by a software update). Fortunately there&#8217;s a work around for Android phones, just follow these simple steps.

  1. First you will need to grab [BTmono](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bedoig.BTmono&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5iZWRvaWcuQlRtb25vIl0.) from Google Play
  2. Make sure your phone is connected to the car
  3. Turn BTmono on and start playing any audio file on your phone

Blue & Me will start playing the audio as if it&#8217;s a phone call and the multifunction screen on the dashboard will display &#8220;Private Number&#8221;. Unfortunately the audio quality is really crappy, so it might not be good for playing music but at least it&#8217;s good enough for listening to audio books.

### Update

It&#8217;s a bit frustrating that &#8220;Private Number&#8221; will be stuck on your screen and you won&#8217;t be able to access any other functions. Fortunately, I found a solution for that. Turn on cruise control (just rotate the stalk, no need to engage it), then quickly turn it off again. While the screen is still saying &#8220;Cruise Control Off&#8221; press the trip button and the screen will get back to displaying trip data.
