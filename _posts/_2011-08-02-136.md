If you have aÂ Synaptics multi-touch trackpad you would probably be wondering why the three-finger flick/swipe to go backward and forward isn&#8217;t working in Google Chrome. The fault isn&#8217;t from Google, it&#8217;s from Synaptics. Fortunately this can be easily fixed with a simple registry edit.

  1. From the start menu, type regedit and choose regedit.exe
  2. Go to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Synaptics
  3. Export the registry keys by right clicking on Synaptics and choosing Export
  4. Open the exported registry key using a text editor and replace every instance of &#8220;Mozilla Firefox&#8221; with &#8220;Google Chome&#8221; and &#8220;firefox.exe&#8221; with &#8220;chrome.exe&#8221;
  5. Go back to the registry editor and choose File, Import and choose the file you just edited
  6. Restart you computer
  7. Voila! Three-finger swipes working perfectly
