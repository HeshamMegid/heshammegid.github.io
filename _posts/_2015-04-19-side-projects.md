  At any given moment I&#8217;m always working on a little side project. Some times they ship, usually they don&#8217;t (I only have <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id684374465">TracKit</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id974985042">Photos Cleaner</a> on the App Store, and one more app in review as of this writing).
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Usually when I start telling people about the side projects that I&#8217;m working on, they wonder why am I wasting my time on projects that I have no interest in monetizing or that might not even ship. I have a very good reason.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Stupid side projects are always a healthy thing to do. You don&#8217;t expect any of your side projects to be the next Facebook or Twitter, or to change the world, but you keep on building them anyway. You build them because they are things you personally need. You build them for education, either about a certain technology or a certain aspect of business.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Since I&#8217;m usually not expecting to make money out of my side projects, I skip the market validation part and jump right into building them. That sometimes means sketching it on a piece of paper to make it clearer for myself, or on other occasions it means starting to code right away.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  In side projects I get to be as meticulous as I want. I have no deadlines so I get to do things the way I see best, which occasionally means completely scrapping some parts and rebuilding them, and that is always great for learning. I also get to try whatever new crazy technology or language that looks cool but is too crazy to use in my full-time job.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It would be great if a side project turned into something that makes a decent amount of money, but that&#8217;s never the intention when I&#8217;m working on them, and that&#8217;s what makes them very special.Â I&#8217;ve learned a lot working on side projects, and I&#8217;ll continue to do it for as long as I have the time.

  What stupid (or not so stupid) side project have you recently worked on?
