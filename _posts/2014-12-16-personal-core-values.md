Great companies define a set of core values that they live by. These core values help keep everyone aligned to what the company believes in and form a healthy culture.

A while ago, I went through the exercise of helping define core values for the company I worked at. It inspired me to come up with a similar list of personal core values to live by. This list has been very helpful to me day-to-day and especially helpful whenever I need to take a major life decision. I occasionally look at my list of core values and see if what I&#8217;m currently doing with my life, or that major decision I&#8217;m about to take matches with those values.

I&#8217;m constantly tweaking this set of core values to better reflect what I would like to do with my life. Here&#8217;s my current list:

  1. **Passion is not optional.** Being passionate about whatever you are doing is the most important thing. Everything else is secondary.
  2. **Leave your comfort zone from time to time.** Doing so is critical for the creative process to thrive.
  3. **Embrace change.** Don’t live in fear of the new. Embrace change. Embrace diversity of opinion and always be open to new experiences.
  4. **Accept different people.** Accept people who think in ways that are different from you, and people of different religions, cultures, and races.
  5. **Embrace simplicity and minimalism.** Avoid clutter in everything you do in your life. Live only by what you really need.
  6. **Take risks.** Don’t play your life safe and end up having regrets about the things you could have done.
  7. **Have a beginners mind. **Have an attitude of openness and eagerness to learn and a lack of preconceptions. Face life the way a small child does, full of curiosity, wonder and amazements.

I&#8217;m sharing this list in the hope of inspiring others to come up with their own list, or copying mine and tweaking it until it matches their personality and what they want to do with their lives.
