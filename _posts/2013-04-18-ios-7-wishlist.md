I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone of us that uses iOS always has a wishlist for the upcoming version. I&#8217;ll keep mine simple. Those are the top 8 things that I wish to have in iOS 7.

  1. Better sharing between apps (hint: Android)
  2. Ability to set default apps
  3. A better email app
  4. A better camera app
  5. Quick access to settings like turning on/off Wi-Fi & Bluetooth, changing brightness, etc&#8230;
  6. More options for organizing home screens
  7. Airdrop
  8. Automatic app updates

What are yours?
